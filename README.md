# Baking Timer

This app allows a baker to set a timer that counts down to zero, and
then starts counting negative in order to keep track of how much total
time has elapsed. This is useful when baking, for example, if you check on
something and determine it's not quite done and needs another minute or so. This
timer keeps track of the total elapsed time to make sure that you don't exceed
the recommended baking time range.
